# jade-collaboration design

Real-time co-editing of `.docx` and `.xlsx` (later `.pptx`) by any mix of
people and AI agents, on top of the jade engine
([jade-rs/jade-core](https://github.com/jade-rs/jade-core)).

## 1. Why neither a pure CRDT nor pure OT

A CRDT guarantees that replicas which have seen the same operations hold the
same state. It does not guarantee that this state is a *valid document*.
Convergence is only free for operations that are **invariant-confluent**
(Bailis et al., VLDB 2015): merging two valid states must give a valid state.
Plain text insertion and deletion are; most office structure is not.

| Concurrent pair | Each alone | Both merged by a CRDT |
| --- | --- | --- |
| merge `A1:B2` ∥ merge `B2:C3` | valid | overlapping merge regions — no file format can express it |
| join paragraph P with Q ∥ insert a table between P and Q | valid | a table in the middle of a paragraph |
| insert row above row 5 ∥ type `=A5` | valid | the formula points at the wrong row |
| delete column C ∥ merge `B1:D1` | valid | a merge anchored on a deleted column |
| sort range ∥ edit a cell in it | valid | the edit lands on a different record |

`lean/JadeCollab/Sequencer.lean` proves the first row mechanically
(`crdt_union_breaks_invariant`).

Operational Transformation with a central server can keep invariants, but its
transform functions are quadratic in the number of operation kinds and
notoriously hard to get right for trees and tables; every structural command
jade already has (≈100 `HeadlessCommand`s) would need a transform against every
other.

## 2. The hybrid: two lanes, one log

Every operation is addressed by **stable identifiers** (CRDT style), never by
index, and is classified into one of two lanes:

* **Convergent lane** — invariant-confluent operations. They commute with every
  other operation, so a replica applies them immediately and never rolls them
  back. Text insert/delete inside a paragraph (an RGA sequence CRDT), paragraph
  split, and cell values (last-writer-wins registers).
* **Sequenced lane** — operations that need coordination. A replica applies them
  tentatively; the central **sequencer** validates them against the
  authoritative state in arrival order and either commits or rejects them.
  Table rows/columns/merges, paragraph join, table insertion, formulas, and
  anything that rewrites references.

There is still exactly one totally ordered log per document, kept by the
server. The lanes only decide *whether an operation may be rejected* and
*whether a replica has to rebase when it arrives*:

```
             client A                         server (per document)                  client B
  local op ─▶ view.apply (optimistic)          ┌────────────────────────┐
          └─▶ Submit{client_seq, base_seq, op} ─▶│ dedup (replica, seq)   │
                                               │ validate + apply on     │
                                               │   authoritative model   │──▶ Sequenced{seq, op} ─▶ confirmed.apply
                                               │ materialize into jade   │                          convergent: view.apply
                                               │   (WordDocument / xlsx) │                          sequenced : view = confirmed + pending
                                               │ append to log           │
                                               └────────────────────────┘
                                                   └─▶ Rejected{client_seq, reason} (sequenced lane only)
```

Why keep a CRDT when a server orders everything anyway?

1. **No index transformation.** Operations name the characters, rows and
   columns they touch, so an operation computed against an old view is still
   meaningful against a newer state. There are no OT transform functions.
2. **Typing never rebases.** Remote convergent operations are applied straight
   to the optimistic view (they commute with the pending local operations —
   `lean/JadeCollab/Reconcile.lean`, `fast_path_sound`). Only the rarer
   structural operations make a replica replay its pending queue.
3. **Rejections are rare and local.** Only sequenced operations can be
   rejected, and only when a concurrent structural change made them invalid.
4. **Offline / peer text merges remain possible** for the convergent lane.

Why keep the server when a CRDT handles text?

1. Invariants that need coordination (§1) are checked in one place, in one
   order.
2. **The server is the only component that touches OOXML.** It applies each
   committed operation to a jade `WordDocument` / `HeadlessWorkbook` in log
   order, translating identifier-addressed operations to the index-addressed
   `HeadlessCommand`s jade already implements. jade's Word-compatible editing
   (run splitting, formula rewriting on row insert, unknown XML preserved) is
   reused as is and never has to commute.
3. One authoritative log is the audit trail for AI edits, the unit of
   persistence and the basis for undo and access control.

## 3. Identifiers and clocks

* `ReplicaId(u64)` — handed out by the server on join, never reused for a
  document. Replica `0` is the document's *origin* (content loaded from the
  file).
* `Id { lamport, replica }` — totally ordered (lamport first). Every replica
  keeps a Lamport clock that is advanced past every identifier it observes, so
  a child is always created with a larger identifier than its parent. The RGA
  integration rule depends on this.
* `client_seq` — per replica, strictly increasing. `(replica, client_seq)`
  identifies a submission; the sequencer drops duplicates, so a client can
  resend its pending queue after a reconnect. (This replaces the prototype's
  `op_id` / `CollaborativeSessionTracker` in jade-core.)
* `base_seq` — the last log position the client had seen when it made the
  operation. Operations whose meaning depends on index-based text (formulas)
  use it to detect that a structural change slipped in between.

## 4. Data model

### Text: RGA with paragraph marks (`jade-collab-core::rga`)

A *story* (the body, one table cell, …) is one RGA sequence of atoms: a
character or a paragraph mark. Each atom names the atom it was inserted after
(its *parent*); deletion leaves a tombstone. The visible order is a depth-first
walk of the parent tree with siblings in **descending** identifier order.

The specification (`rga::spec`, and `lean/JadeCollab/Rga.lean`) is literally
that: the state is the *set* of insert operations plus the set of deleted
identifiers, and the document is a pure function of those sets. Lean proves
that replicas which received the same operations, in any order and with any
duplication, render the same document. The production implementation keeps a
linear array and integrates with the classic RGA skip rule; a property test
checks it against the specification on random concurrent histories.

A story's last paragraph has no mark atom (Word's final paragraph mark cannot
be deleted). Splitting a paragraph inserts a mark: convergent. Joining deletes
a mark: sequenced, because a table may be anchored to that mark.

### Tables (`jade-collab-core::grid`)

A table is anchored *after* a paragraph mark of its parent story (or at the
story start), which keeps "a story ends with a paragraph" and "a table is never
inside a paragraph" true under concurrent splits. Rows and columns are ordered
lists of identifiers with tombstones; a cell is the story keyed by
`(RowId, ColId)`. Structural deletes only tombstone, so a concurrent edit to a
cell in a deleted row still commutes — it lands in an invisible story.

Merge regions are rectangles named by their corner row/column identifiers. The
grid's validity predicate (all regions alive, well-formed and pairwise
non-overlapping) is checked by the sequencer for every structural operation.

### Spreadsheets (`jade-xlsx-collab`)

Sheets have row and column identifier lists (sequenced lane) and cells are
last-writer-wins registers keyed by `(RowId, ColId)` (convergent lane).
Formulas are sequenced: the server rejects a formula whose `base_seq` predates
a structural change of its sheet, since its A1 references were written against
another grid. (Next step: store formulas with identifier references and print
them back to A1 at materialization.)

## 5. Materialization into jade

The server owns one jade document per room and applies, for every committed
operation, the `HeadlessCommand`s (docx) or `HeadlessWorkbook` calls (xlsx)
that realise it, computing paragraph indices and byte offsets from the model at
that point of the log. jade addresses paragraphs by its flattened *paragraph
surface* index; the model mirrors the body/table part of that enumeration and a
test checks the two agree on real fixtures.

Clients do not need jade: an AI agent, a CLI or a test works on the model. A
jade editor client additionally applies the same effects to its local
`WordDocument`.

## 6. Components

| Crate | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `jade-collab-core` | identifiers, Lamport clock, RGA (+ executable spec), LWW register, table grid |
| `jade-collab-sync` | `Document` trait, lanes, wire protocol, `Sequencer` (server core), `Replica` (client core), deterministic network simulator |
| `jade-docx-collab` | docx model + operations, loading from a jade `WordDocument`, materialization to `HeadlessCommand`s, index-addressed intent API (migrated from jade-core) |
| `jade-xlsx-collab` | xlsx model + operations, loading from / materializing into a jade `HeadlessWorkbook` |
| `jade-collab-server` | WebSocket server (one actor thread per document, since jade documents are `!Send`), WebSocket client, `jade-collab` CLI |

## 7. Verification strategy

Tests are written first. Three layers:

1. **Lean 4** (`lean/`) — properties of the *specifications*:
   strong eventual consistency of the RGA spec and of LWW registers,
   the sequencer preserving any validity predicate, a concrete proof that CRDT
   union of two valid merges breaks the table invariant, and soundness of the
   client fast path (convergent operations commute ⇒ applying a remote
   convergent operation to the optimistic view equals rebuilding it).
2. **Property-based tests** (`proptest`) — the implementation against the
   specification (RGA differential test), convergence of random concurrent
   histories across N replicas under random message scheduling, grid
   invariants under random structural operations, and docx/xlsx model ↔ jade
   agreement after random edit sequences.
3. **Example tests** — protocol edge cases, real fixtures through jade, and an
   end-to-end WebSocket session with a human-like and an agent-like client.

## 8. Out of scope for the first milestone

Rich-text formatting as a convergent mark CRDT (Peritext-style; for now
formatting commands are sequenced and addressed by character identifiers),
docx merged cells, nested tables, text boxes and notes, comments and tracked
changes, persistence beyond export, authentication, presence/cursors, history
compaction, and `.pptx`.
